Front End
- Style: Goals table appears below stats --> visually unappealing
- Get rid of Method=Productivity/Social Media, that's category
	Method indicates how the goal tapers from start to end; currently "linear" is supported
- Display goal progress under goals tab (Use requestGoalData POST method)

Back End
- Add checks to ensure robust functionality
	- user ID and goal ID must be valid
	- goal date range must be valid
	- goal hostname must be valid
