Front End
- Style: Goals table appears below stats --> visually unappealing --- RESOLVED
- Get rid of Method=Productivity/Social Media, that's category --- RESOLVED
	Method indicates how the goal tapers from start to end; currently "linear" is supported
	
- Display goal progress under goals tab (Use requestGoalData POST method)
	5/27 - tbd:
	- fix the data display entries within the table
	- actually display form input entry
	- content security policy issue
